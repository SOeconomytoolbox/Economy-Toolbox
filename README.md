# Economy-Toolbox
advanced economy-oriented toolbox for Space Origin

This script is giving you some tools allowing your economy/resources management to be a bit less tedious.
There is no task automation as the script is only here to compute and suggest actions whose execution is always up to the player.
All the data used by the script is taken client-side, there is nothing the script does that a player can't do himself.
If there is any issue with the execution of a script-added tool, please restart your game. Refreshing your game session is the best way to have fully working tools.

- The UpgradeHelper tool is taking a disabled upgrade from an opened building in your game, and compute which resources you could sell/buy to get quicker to the upgrade. It also shows the waiting time with the suggested trades and w/o.
It is recommended to have only one building opened when using this tool.
The trades are computed with the stock exchange of the market at the time of the use of the tool. The results of the effective trades may differ slightly than the previsions, due to rounded calculations of the game : use your calculator and you'll see.
If you have a negative waiting time, it means that you will have more than required to do the upgrade, after making the suggested trades.

- The TimeLeft tool is a simple way to have in your hangar a similar indicator as the one in the mines regarding the delay until full storage. If your production is negative, you will see the time you have left before the storage gets empty.

- The Adv.PremiumToolbox is a bundle of different tools that will suggest you some comercial operations on the premium interface :
  - The Equalizer tool simply indicates the operations to equalize the amount of resources between X bases. However, I advise to use this tool only with pairs, since it's the only situation where there is only one way to do the operations.
  - The SmoothFiller tool indicates the amount of resources you should add in your hangars to have an equalized filling time between the types of resources selectionned.
  - The SmoothRemoval tool indicates the amount of resources you should withdraw from your hangars to have an equalized filling time between the types of resources selectionned.
You can select the base/type of resources you want to work with by clicking on the name/icon.
